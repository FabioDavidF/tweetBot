# tweetBot
This is a bot written in python with selenium that tweets for you periodically. The script was HEAVILY based on the article linked below, I just put everything together and made some improvements
For the script to work you will need:
-Python(preferably 3.8+)
-Selenium

If you are not familiar with python and programming, do the following:
-Download and install python over at python.org
-Open windows' CMD
-Run the command "pip install selenium" (without the quotation marks)
-Run the command "cd Desktop" (without the quotation marks)
(Make sure the script is in your desktop for these commands to work)
-Run the command "python tweetbot.py" (without the quotation marks)

And that's it, it will gather the things needed on cmd, just be sure to make good tweets with it
